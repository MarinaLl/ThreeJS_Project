There are no additional furniture or other objects in such graphics. Usually the background color is white, but there are no obstacles for it to be another color. Very often the background of the product itself is not "flat". You can put shadows on it, which makes the graphics look much more attractive.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">With the help of such visualizations, you can present literally any product. Such graphics will be great for online stores or advertising websites. They will also look good on social media.</p>

One of them is the inability to perfectly cut out the product from the photo. The edges are then jagged, and there may also be white glows. In order to avoid such a situation, a great option will be to take advantage of the benefits of 3D graphics.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">3D visualizations without a background are very versatile. You can freely manipulate them and create marketing materials from them in the way that suits you best. There are no obstacles to later transform such graphics into 3D visualizations on a white background or in an arrangement.</p>
